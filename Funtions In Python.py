# Functions In Python

# Like in mathematics, where a function takes an argument and produces a result, it
# does so in Python as well

# The general form of a Python function is:
# def function_name(arguments):
#   {lines telling the function what to do to produce the result}
#   return result

# lets consider producing a function that returns x^2 + y^2
def squared(x, y):
    result = x**2 + y**2
    return result


print(squared(10, 2))


# A new function
def born (country):
    return print("I am from " + country)


born("greensboro")
